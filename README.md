- 👋 Hi, I’m @victor.dsman
- 👀 I’m interested in Games in general, but mostly Game Development and Game Design, and a bit of Game Art (I love PIXELS!).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 👨‍💻 Computer Science in UFRRJ, doing 🔮 Game Development Courses and playing ⚔️ Ragnarök Online.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Game Development or Apps that use Game Concepts to make it richer.
- 📫 How to reach me: victor.rl.oliveira@gmail.com
