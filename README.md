# 👋😃 Hi, I’m Victor Leta!
- 👀 I’m interested in Games in general, but mostly Game Development and Game Design, and a bit of Game Art.
- 🖥 I'm also interested in Front-End Development.
- 👨‍💻 I’m currently a Computer Science undergrad in UFRRJ, doing Game Development and Front-End Development courses during my free time.
- ⚔️ And during my free-free-time playing Souls games(or Ragnarök Online).
- 💻 I’m currently looking for internship opportunities.
