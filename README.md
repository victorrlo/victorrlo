- 👋 Hi, I’m @victor.rlo
- 👀 I’m interested in Games in general, but mostly Game Development and Game Design, and a bit of Game Art (I love PIXELS!).
- 🍠 I'm also interested in Front-End Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently a 👨‍💻 Computer Science undergrad in UFRRJ, doing 🔮 Game Development and Front-End Development courses during my free time and during my free-free-time playing ⚔️ Souls games(or Ragnarök Online... 😆).
- 💞️ I’m currently looking for internship opportunities. 
- 📫 How to reach me: victor.rl.oliveira@gmail.com
